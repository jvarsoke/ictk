<p class="bodyFont"> <span class="heading">Summary:</span> The Internet Chess 
  ToolKit is a Java based set of libraries and widgets useful for performing common 
  tasks such as reading SAN, PGN, FEN, generating legal moves, connecting to online chess server (future), and GUI widgets (future). The net libraries 
  convert ICS (Internet Chess Server) output into java events. This library is 
  licensed under the <a href="http://www.fsf.org/licenses/gpl.html">GPL v2</a>.</p>
<p><span class="heading">About:</span> <span class="bodyFont">The purpose of the 
  Internet Chess ToolKit is to provide an extensible library to facilitate the 
  development of internet server clients, bots, training programs, peer-to-peer 
  players, and and various other programs useful for the game player. The library 
  was designed with a high level of abstraction and utilization of object oriented 
  design patterns to make it extensible; The model set up should allow for implementations 
  of many games besides Chess, which is the main focus of this library. Such other 
  games might include chess variants like BugHouse, or completely different games 
  like scrabble and the Chinese game of Go. Another goal of the library is ease 
  of use. A lot of effort has gone into comprehensive documentation and providing 
  sensible names for methods, as well as providing many convenience methods.</span></p>
<p class="bodyFont">The goal of this library has never been to facilitate the 
  development of engines. The amount of objects created, and the delegation of 
  legal move generation to each of the pieces is not conducive to the efficiency 
  required to make a competitive engine. Of course if speed is not a goal of your 
  engine it might be interesting to use this library. All that's really needed 
  is an evaluation routine to chose which of the legal moves the computer prefers.</p>
<p class="bodyFont">Much of this library is dedicated to providing support for 
  accepted game notation formats such as <a href="http://www.yacdb.com/pgn/pgn_lidx.htm">PGN</a> 
  (a standard game history notation) and FEN (a position notation). In later releases 
  the library will support less conventional notations such as <a href="http://scid.sourceforge.net">Scid</a> 
  databases, <a href="http://www.enpassant.dk/chess/palview/enhancedpgn.htm">XPGN</a>, 
  <a href="http://www.saremba.de/chessgml/">ChessGML</a> and others (if anyone has the specs on the current <a href="http://www.chessbase.com">ChessBase</a> 
  format please email me). As much as is possible the library also tries to support 
  internationalization, with priority on presentation and then on archival.</p>
<p class="bodyFont">The net libraries enable programs to connect to internet game 
  playing servers. The primary focus at this point is on establishing support 
  for <a href="http://www.freechess.org">FICS</a> (a free as in beer server), 
  but later versions will also support <a href="http://www.chessclub.com">ICC</a> 
  (a pay server similar to FICS). The main purpose of the library is to remove 
  the grunt work and screen-scraping tedium from the developer by translating 
  all ICS output into Java event objects. In general you connect to the server 
  and then objects register to listen for different types of events. All the data 
  has already been parsed for you; all you need do is make some sort of use of 
  it. Unfortunately, there are <em>many</em> different ICS events, but over time 
  ictk hopes to support them all.</p>
<p class="bodyFont">GUI widgets and other commonly useful objects will be added 
  to the library as well, however this task is very low priority at the moment. 
  Contributions in this area are more than welcome.</p>
