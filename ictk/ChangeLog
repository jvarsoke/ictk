0.2.0 - 2003-10-03 FICS Support (limited)
   [net]    added FICS support to main branch of library

   [fics]   removed BlockMode message chunking
   [fics]   recoded login sequence to not use StringBuffer
            Also now correctly determines beginning of session.
   [fics]   added guest account detection on login
   [fics]   added Timeseal support
            {thanks: Alexander Maryanovsky (Jin)}
   [fics]   changed FICS.*Events to FICS.*EventParsers to benefit from
            loose coupling of parsers to events.  This will allow server
	    event translations.
   [fics]   changed FICSEvents now implement the Singelton design pattern.
   [fics]   added test suites for the parsers
   [fics]   added template files for Parsers and ParserTest to auto generate
            these files.
   [fics]   added support for following events: style12, match request,
            kibitz, whisper, say, tell, channel tell, shout, c/t/-shout, emote,
	    move list, pin, gin, seek ads, seek remove, seek clear, game results.

   [net]    removed most of the ICS*Event.java and FICS*EventParser.java files.
   [net]    added XSLT java code generation for ICSEvents and FICSEventParsers
            Since most event objects are simple and repetitive code they are
	    now generated using XALAN (by default).

   [dev]    added code generation target to build file
            The build file now has a XALAN dependency by default if you wish
	    to use the code generator.

   [sample] fixed 791562 - SimplePGNDemo not checking or null on getResult()
            {thanks: Franck (obelixft)}
   [sample] added SimpleICSClient
            This sample program logs onto FICS and displays server output
	    on the console (System.out). The output is ANSI color coded
	    as defined by ANSIConsole. The sample code intends to show how
	    to register to listen to events.  An alternative channel listener
	    is provided.

   [chess]  fixed 801272 - PGNWriter added superfluious results
            PGN standard specifies only an end result, not results for
	    variations.
	    {thanks: Jerome Zago}
   [chess]  fixed 791572 - PGNReader stopped on \n\n assuming end of PGN
            Changed the reader to use StreamTokenizer and ends on either EOF
	    or seeing a proper result.
	    {thanks: Franck (obelixft)}

0.1.3 - 2003-08-17 a bug, events & and a CLI Board
   [chess]  fixed 784950 - wrong disambiguation
            This ultra rare bug was produced when a captured piece, of the
	    same class, had the same destination in its uncleared leagal moves
	    list as the piece uniqueness was tested for.  Leagal dests
	    are now cleared when the capture flag is set on a piece.  Also
	    ChessBoard.isDestUniqueForClass() now does consider captured 
	    pieces.
	    {thanks: Jermone Zago for the bug report}

   [cli]    added 788096 - CLI display for ChessBoards
            Also added BoardListener keep displays notified of changes in the
	    underlying model.
   [cli]    added TxChessBoardDisplay
            This is an only email CC chess coorispondence program's output
	    format.  There are several options to control how the output looks.

   [chess]  added Board controllers like History and ChessMove now 
            trigger Board to send updateBoard() to all BoardListeners.
	    When History does a long series of moves (such as in rewind()
	    or fastForward()) a TRAVERSAL_BEGIN event is sent first to notify
	    the Listener that it might not want to update the board until
	    the TRAVERSAL_END is called.

   [sample] added CLIPGNViewer
            This is a simple Command-Line Interface (CLI) PGN viewer.  It
	    demonstrates how to use a BoardDisplay.


0.1.2 - 2003-08-04 bug fixes (mostly)
   [dev]    source distribution no longer comes with javadoc, since it can
            be easily created through the build tool.
   [dev]    build.xml now uses the JUnit task instead of calling AllTests
            directly as before.  junit.print.results can be used to 
	    toggle summary display.

   [docs]   default distribution docs will not be for "public" members only.
            To create docs with different access use the build tool against
	    the source with -Ddocs.access=<access_type> on the command line.

   [sample] added 711183 - sample code
            SimpleChessGameExample demonstrates how to add moves to a 
	    game in the code.  SimplePGNDemo reads in a PGN, writes it out,
	    show the last FEN, and provides some stats on the mainline.

   [chess]  fixed 775816 - SAN reader wasn't respecting full dis-ambiguation.
            {thanks: Jerome Zago for the bug report}
   [chess]  fixed 776369 - NAG followed by comment set as prenotation
            {thanks: Jerome Zago for the bug report}
   [chess]  fixed 776408 - double annotation do not respect variation bounds
   [chess]  fixed 777732 - PGNWriter not writing numeric NAGs
            {thanks: Jerome Zago for the bug report}
   [chess]  fixed 777741 - Black resigns on White's move yields wrong result.
            Carved out pre-Result object result code.  Now all results are
	    as Result objects attached to the last move in the list.  Currently
	    there is no provision for assuring that a Resulting move is
	    terminal.  Also several functions were removed: 
	    ChessBoard.setResign(), getResign, setDraw, getDraw, and similar 
	    were removed from ChessMove.  You should now be using getResult().
	    {thanks: Jermone Zago for the bug report}
   [chess]  fixed 778731 - non-numeric NAG "RR" and "N" not parsed by PGNReader.
   [chess]  fixed 778408 - PGNWriter groups unrelated variations
            {thanks: Jermone Zago for the bug report}
   [chess]  fixed 779762 - PGNReader ignores duplicate continuation
            This is actually by design; History.add() did not allow duplicate
	    continuations to be added in hopes of trimming the tree.  But
	    the body of PGNs out sometimes take advantage of duplicate
	    continuations to extend games past resignation, or have different
	    annotations.  Thus, History.add() now allows duplicate
	    continuations.
	    {thanks: Jermone Zago for the bug report}
   [chess]  fixed 780102 - PGNReader thinks result is for variation
	    {thanks: Jermone Zago for the bug report}
   [chess]  changed NAG object methods to no longer insist on 'short'.  Also
            changed the names of the methods to fit this change.  Several
	    new methods also added.
   [chess]  added ContinuationList.find(Move) and findIndex(Move).  These
            find continuations with the same coordinates as the input move.
	    Both methods return an array of matches.
   [chess]  added History.deepEquals(history, true) now checks prenotations
            and Results for all continuation lines.  A null result is treated
	    as equal to isUndecided()

0.1.1 - 2003-07-20 bug fixes
   [dev]    fixed 758852 - build.xml needed manual doodling for JUNIT to work.
            The old build.xml file required the user to change the default
	    home directory and possibly the junit.home variable.  The fix
	    includes using Ant's ability to detect environment variables on
	    most platforms.  An error is printed if Ant can't find that info
	    so users can manually set it.
	    {thanks: Jerome Zago for the bug report & suggestions}
   [dev]    added "dist" targets to build.xml.  This allows for easy building
            of the distribution files.
   [dev]    added "cvs" target to build.xml
            By specifying the cvs.tag you can retrieve releases from the CVS.
	    By default the build file will get the release that build file
	    corrisponds to.  If you want the development version from the CVS
	    you should specify -Dcvs.tag=HEAD on the Ant command-line.
   [dev]    added "cvs" ability to log onto the developers' CVS.
            Sometimes the public/anonymous CVS isn't very current. You can
	    use the developers' CVS by -Dcvs.login=<sf_userid>

   [test]   fixed 771165 - testCheckmateSmother3: wrong assertions
            Test was passing because of bug 771063.  Test corrected.
	    {thanks: Jerome Zago for the bug report}
   [test]   added debug info for PGNWriter

   [chess]  fixed 759466 - PGN variation w/o space seperating paren and move.
            For example: (2.Bc4) instead of ( 2.Bc4 )
	    {thanks: Jerome Zago for the bug report & patch}
   [chess]  fixed 771063 - double-check does not generate correct legal moves.
            {thanks: Jerome Zago and David Spencer for reporting the bug}
   [chess]  fixed 773597 - annotation w/o space between delimeters caused error
            {thanks: Jerome Zago for the bug report}
   [chess]  fixed 771199 - annotation before move list not handled correctly
            Now supports comments before games and before moves.  For there
	    to be a comment before a move (called a Prenotation) in a PGN
	    there must be a comment after the previous move -- except
	    in the case of a variation.
   [chess]  fixed 774076 - PGNWriter error on writing null GameInfo
   [chess]  fixed 774085 - PGNWriter error on writing null History
   [chess]  fixed 774510 - EnPassant did not escape check.
            {thanks: Jerome Zago for the bug report}
   [chess]  fixed extra space pre-appended to O-O in SAN
   [chess]  added ChessBoard.isDoubleCheck() and changed isCheck() to be
            true when double-check is true.
   [chess]  added Move.getPrenotation() and family.  These are for 
            comments/annotations before the move.
   [chess]  added PGNReader/Writer now handle Pre-Notations.  Prenotations
            might come as comments before a game or before variations.  They
	    are also determined when there are N comments in a row;
	    N-1 will be appended to the Annotation of the former move
	    and the Nth will become the Prenotation of the latter move.
   [chess]  added 778422 - PGNWriter options
            several options have been added to PGNWriter.  These include
	    the ability to affect how the NAGs and symbolic notations are
	    presented in the output, turning on or off Variation and Comment
	    output, and the ability to intent the 1st variation off the mainline
	    and comments on the main line.
